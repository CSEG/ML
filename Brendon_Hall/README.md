# CSEG Geochemical Facies Analysis

This is the CSEG repo for [Brendon Hall's](https://github.com/brendonhall/) article, *Geochemical Facies Analysis using Unsupervised Machine Learning*, in the January 2018 [CSEG Recorder](https://csegrecorder.com/), focused on Machine Learning.

This tutorial demonstrates how dimensionality reduction and unsupervised machine learning can be used to analyze X-ray fluorescence measurements of cuttings samples. 

The notebook contains the article and the full code used to generate the results. 

Please do not hesitate to contact [Brendon](https://github.com/brendonhall/) if you have any comments or questions.
